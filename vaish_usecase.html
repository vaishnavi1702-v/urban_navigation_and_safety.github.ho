    <h1>Estimated Time Travel Calculation: Tracking & Analyzing Travel History</h1>

    <section>
        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>The objective of this system is to calculate and estimate travel time for future journeys based on historical travel data. The system provides predictions of expected travel times by analyzing past routes, conditions, and travel patterns to help users plan their journeys more effectively.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The app uses historical travel data stored in external files to estimate travel times for upcoming trips. By evaluating factors such as travel speed, route preferences, and time of day, the system calculates how long a journey will likely take under similar conditions. The goal is to give users a clear estimate of travel time, helping them plan better routes and make informed decisions.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="benefits">

        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Storage:</strong>
                <ul class="concepts">
                    <li><strong>Travel Data Logs:</strong> Travel history is stored in external files using file handling (e.g., fstream in C++) for long-term storage. The logs include details such as travel route, travel time, distance, and timestamps.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Time Estimation Calculation:</strong>
                <ul class="concepts">
                    <li><strong>Route Time Prediction:</strong> Historical data is used to predict future travel times based on similar routes, travel times, and past conditions. For example, if a user frequently travels a specific route at a certain time of day, the system estimates travel time by considering the average past travel time for that route.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Travel Pattern Analysis:</strong>
                <ul class="concepts">
                    <li><strong>Travel Time Trends:</strong> Users can analyze patterns in their past journeys, identifying times of day or routes where travel tends to be quicker or slower.</li>
                    <li><strong>Peak Hours Identification:</strong> The app can analyze trends and identify peak traffic times, helping users avoid delays during high-traffic periods.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Historical Data Usage:</strong>
                <ul class="concepts">
                    <li><strong>Route Frequency Analysis:</strong> By analyzing how often a user travels specific routes, the system can predict likely future routes and suggest estimated travel times based on historical patterns.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Real-Time Adjustment:</strong>
                <ul class="concepts">
                    <li><strong>Dynamic Time Adjustment:</strong> The estimated time calculation can adjust based on real-time conditions (traffic, weather, etc.) and previous historical data trends to provide the most accurate prediction.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Concepts Used</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>File System:</strong> File handling with fstream is used for managing the reading and writing of travel history data into structured files, ensuring secure long-term storage.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Storage & Retrieval:</strong> Travel data is saved in structured external files (e.g., .txt, .csv, .json, or .xml files), making it easily accessible for analysis and future retrieval.</li>
            <li><strong>Time-Series Data Analysis:</strong> The system processes time-series data (e.g., travel times over different days or times) to predict the most accurate estimated travel time based on past performance during similar conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>Predictive Algorithms:</strong> Machine learning or statistical models are implemented to analyze travel history and predict future travel times more accurately, considering variables like time of day, weather, and traffic patterns.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Compression and Optimization:</strong> The data stored in external files is optimized for quick retrieval, especially when dealing with large datasets of historical travel information.</li>
            <li><strong>Historical and Real-Time Data Integration:</strong> Combining historical data (travel times from previous trips) with real-time data (current traffic, weather, and road conditions) ensures more accurate predictions for future travel times.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Integrity & Synchronization:</strong> Error-checking mechanisms ensure that data logs are consistent, reliable, and free from corruption, guaranteeing the accuracy of travel time estimates.</li>
