    <section>
        <h2>1) Problems in Nature: Iteration, Recursion, and Backtracking</h2>
        <p>Different types of problems can be tackled using iteration, recursion, and backtracking. Each approach has its use cases and performance characteristics.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Iteration:</strong> Repeats a set of instructions until a condition is met. Suitable for problems where a direct loop suffices, e.g., summing elements in an array. Time complexity is typically <code>O(n)</code>.</li>
            <li><strong>Recursion:</strong> A function calls itself to solve subproblems. It’s useful when a problem can be broken down into smaller instances. Time complexity varies, but simple recursive problems can be <code>O(n)</code>.</li>
            <li><strong>Backtracking:</strong> A method to explore all potential solutions by trying partial solutions and abandoning those that fail. Time complexity can be exponential, such as <code>O(2^n)</code> in the worst case, like in the N-Queens problem.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>2) Space and Time Efficiency</h2>
        <p>Optimizing both time and space is key in algorithm design. Time efficiency refers to how quickly an algorithm runs, and space efficiency refers to how much memory it uses.</p>

        <h3>Time Complexity:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Constant Time <code>O(1)</code>:</strong> Does not depend on the input size. Example: Accessing an element in an array.</li>
            <li><strong>Logarithmic Time <code>O(log n)</code>:</strong> Reduces the input size in each step. Example: Binary search.</li>
            <li><strong>Linear Time <code>O(n)</code>:</strong> Time increases linearly with the input. Example: Iterating through an array.</li>
            <li><strong>Quadratic Time <code>O(n²)</code>:</strong> Time grows quadratically with input size. Example: Bubble sort.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Space Complexity:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Constant Space <code>O(1)</code>:</strong> The algorithm uses a fixed amount of space. Example: Swapping two variables.</li>
            <li><strong>Linear Space <code>O(n)</code>:</strong> Space increases linearly with the input size. Example: Storing an array.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>3) Algorithm Design Principles</h2>
        <p>Algorithm design is guided by key principles that help create efficient and optimal solutions.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Divide and Conquer:</strong> Breaks a problem into smaller subproblems, solves them independently, and combines the results. Example: Merge Sort and Quick Sort.</li>
            <li><strong>Greedy Algorithms:</strong> Makes the locally optimal choice at each step, aiming for a global optimum. Example: Dijkstra’s algorithm.</li>
            <li><strong>Dynamic Programming:</strong> Solves complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and storing results to avoid redundant work. Example: Fibonacci sequence.</li>
            <li><strong>Backtracking:</strong> Explores all possibilities for finding a solution by incrementally constructing candidates and abandoning them if they fail. Example: N-Queens problem.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>4) Hierarchical Data and Tree Structures</h2>
        <p>Tree structures are key in representing hierarchical data. Common types include binary trees, heaps, and balanced trees.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Binary Trees:</strong> A tree where each node has at most two children. Search operations can be <code>O(log n)</code> in balanced trees.</li>
            <li><strong>Heaps:</strong> A specialized tree-based structure used to implement priority queues. Insert and extract operations take <code>O(log n)</code> time.</li>
            <li><strong>Balanced Trees:</strong> Structures like AVL and Red-Black trees that maintain balanced heights, ensuring <code>O(log n)</code> time for search, insert, and delete operations.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>5) Array Query Algorithms</h2>
        <p>Efficient algorithms for array queries allow us to preprocess data to answer queries quickly.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Binary Search:</strong> Searches a sorted array in <code>O(log n)</code> time.</li>
            <li><strong>Prefix Sum:</strong> Preprocesses an array in <code>O(n)</code> time to allow <code>O(1)</code> time for range sum queries.</li>
            <li><strong>Segment Trees:</strong> Used for efficient range queries and point updates, with time complexity <code>O(log n)</code> for both updates and queries.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>6) Trees vs. Graphs</h2>
        <p>Trees and graphs are both used to represent relationships, but graphs are more general structures with additional flexibility.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Trees:</strong> A tree is a special type of graph with no cycles. Operations like search and insertion in balanced trees take <code>O(log n)</code> time.</li>
            <li><strong>Graphs:</strong> Graphs may have cycles and multiple paths between nodes. Algorithms like BFS and DFS are used to explore graphs, typically having a time complexity of <code>O(V + E)</code>, where <code>V</code> is the number of vertices and <code>E</code> is the number of edges.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>7) Sorting and Searching Algorithms</h2>
        <p>Sorting and searching algorithms are fundamental to organizing and finding data efficiently.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Merge Sort:</strong> A divide-and-conquer algorithm with time complexity <code>O(n log n)</code>. It’s efficient for large datasets.</li>
            <li><strong>Quick Sort:</strong> An average-case <code>O(n log n)</code> sorting algorithm, though it can degrade to <code>O(n²)</code> if not optimized.</li>
            <li><strong>Binary Search:</strong> Efficient search algorithm for sorted arrays with <code>O(log n)</code> time complexity.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>8) Graph Algorithms</h2>
        <p>Graph algorithms are essential for solving problems like shortest paths, minimum spanning trees (MST), and network flow.</p>
        <ul>
            <li
