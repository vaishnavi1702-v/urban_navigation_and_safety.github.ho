    <h2>Connecting Data Structures and Algorithms to Real-World Applications</h2>
    <p>The study of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) is not just a theoretical exercise – it has practical, real-world applications that are essential to the development of efficient software and systems. In the field of engineering, especially software engineering, understanding DSA is crucial for designing systems that are optimized, scalable, and capable of solving complex problems efficiently. Here’s how the course connects to real-world scenarios:</p>
