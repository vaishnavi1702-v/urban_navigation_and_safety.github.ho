<!-- Time Complexity Analysis Section -->
<section class="content">
    <h2>1. Time Complexity Analysis</h2>
    <p><strong>Algorithm:</strong> Time complexity analysis determines how the execution time of an algorithm scales with input size, usually represented by Big-O notation.</p>
    <p><strong>Challenges in Learning:</strong> Understanding how operations scale with input size and identifying the dominant term in time complexity expressions can be difficult for beginners.</p>
    <p><strong>Challenges in Real-World Applications:</strong> Real-world systems may face performance issues not captured by theoretical analysis, such as memory limitations and hardware constraints.</p>
    <p><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Time complexity analysis helps in selecting efficient algorithms that scale well with large data, ensuring systems remain performant.</p>
</section>

<!-- Binary Search Tree (BST) Section -->
<section class="content">
    <h2>2. Binary Search Tree (BST)</h2>
    <p><strong>Algorithm:</strong> A Binary Search Tree is a tree structure where each node has at most two children and follows the ordering property where left children are smaller, and right children are larger.</p>
    <p><strong>Challenges in Learning:</strong> Maintaining the tree’s properties during insertions and deletions, and handling edge cases like duplicates can be complex.</p>
    <p><strong>Challenges in Real-World Applications:</strong> An unbalanced BST can degrade to a linked list (O(n) time complexity), which affects performance. Self-balancing trees like AVL are often used to address this.</p>
    <p><strong>Efficiency:</strong> A balanced BST provides efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations (O(log n)) for large datasets, making it ideal for applications like database indexing.</p>
</section>

<!-- DFS and BFS Section -->
<section class="content">
    <h2>3. DFS and BFS (Depth-First Search & Breadth-First Search)</h2>
    <p><strong>Algorithm:</strong> DFS explores as far as possible along a branch before backtracking using a stack, while BFS explores all neighbors at the current depth before moving deeper using a queue.</p>
    <p><strong>Challenges in Learning:</strong> Understanding when to use DFS vs BFS and implementing recursion for DFS or managing a queue for BFS can be tricky.</p>
    <p><strong>Challenges in Real-World Applications:</strong> DFS may cause stack overflow on deep graphs, while BFS can consume a lot of memory for large graphs due to the queue.</p>
    <p><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Both DFS and BFS have a time complexity of O(V + E) but the choice depends on the specific problem, with DFS being more suitable for certain tasks like topological sorting and BFS for shortest-path finding.</p>
</section>

<!-- Heap Section -->
<section class="content">
    <h2>4. Heap</h2>
    <p><strong>Algorithm:</strong> A heap is a binary tree-based structure that satisfies the heap property. Max-heaps and min-heaps allow efficient access to the maximum and minimum elements, respectively.</p>
    <p><strong>Challenges in Learning:</strong> Understanding how to perform insertion and deletion while maintaining the heap property can be tricky, especially for large datasets.</p>
    <p><strong>Challenges in Real-World Applications:</strong> Heaps are less efficient for arbitrary element access, making them unsuitable for cases where frequent searches are needed.</p>
    <p><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Heaps offer O(log n) time for insertion and deletion, making them ideal for priority queues and other use cases where quick access to the maximum or minimum is necessary.</p>
</section>

<!-- Sorting Algorithms Section -->
<section class="content">
    <h2>5. Sorting Algorithms</h2>
    <p><strong>Algorithm:</strong> Sorting algorithms arrange elements in a particular order. Examples include Merge Sort (O(n log n)), Quick Sort (O(n log n) average), and Heap Sort (O(n log n)).</p>
    <p><strong>Challenges in Learning:</strong> Understanding the mechanisms behind each algorithm and comparing their performance in different situations can be difficult. Sorting with fewer comparisons (e.g., Merge Sort) requires mastering recursion.</p>
    <p><strong>Challenges in Real-World Applications:</strong> Sorting algorithms can be inefficient for specific types of data, and factors like stability and memory usage must be considered in practice.</p>
    <p><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Algorithms like Merge Sort and Quick Sort are efficient for large datasets with average time complexities of O(n log n). However, in certain cases (like pre-sorted or reverse-ordered data), worst-case performance may affect efficiency.</p>
</section>

<!-- Search Algorithms Section -->
<section class="content">
    <h2>6. Search Algorithms</h2>
    <p><strong>Algorithm:</strong> Search algorithms are used to find elements within data structures. Common search algorithms include Binary Search (O(log n)) and Linear Search (O(n)).</p>
    <p><strong>Challenges in Learning:</strong> Understanding when to use Binary Search (only in sorted data) and the inefficiency of Linear Search for large datasets can be confusing.</p>
    <p><strong>Challenges in Real-World Applications:</strong> Binary Search requires sorted data, which may not always be practical. Linear Search is simple but inefficient for large datasets.</p>
    <p><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Binary Search is highly efficient (O(log n)) for sorted data, but Linear Search (O(n)) is only useful for unsorted or small datasets.</p>
</section>

<!-- Graph Algorithms Section -->
<section class="content">
    <h2>7. Graph Algorithms</h2>
    <p><strong>Algorithm:</strong> Graph algorithms are used for analyzing and traversing graphs. Common examples include DFS, BFS, Dijkstra’s Algorithm (O(V²) or O((V + E) log V)), and Prim’s/Kruskal’s Algorithms (O(E log V)) for finding Minimum Spanning Trees.</p>
    <p><strong>Challenges in Learning:</strong> Implementing graph algorithms can be complex due to various graph types (directed, undirected, weighted, unweighted) and the need for different representations (adjacency list vs adjacency matrix).</p>
    <p><strong>Challenges in Real-World Applications:</strong> Large-scale graphs can lead to performance bottlenecks. For example, Dijkstra’s Algorithm can become computationally expensive with dense graphs.</p>
    <p><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Graph algorithms like Dijkstra’s offer efficient solutions for weighted graphs, but real-world applications often require optimization techniques to handle large graphs efficiently.</p>
